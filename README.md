# R Project for The contributions of host population size and maternal transmission rate to fluctuating *Wolbachia* frequencies

This repository contains the code and data for the manuscript 
"The contributions of host population size and maternal transmission rate to fluctuating *Wolbachia* frequencies."

Simulations for the manuscript were conducted using the R programming language. 
The code for the simulations is contained in the `R` directory, see code in 
files `wlbc_sims_no_ci.R`, `wlbc_sims_with_ci_01.R`, and `wlbc_sims_with_ci_45.R`. 
To run those simulations, one must install the R package [`wlbcmodeler`](https://github.com/jmgraham30/wlbcmodeler). 
All other scripts are for data analysis and figure generation. 

Data file `wlbc_simulations_results.csv` is required to run scripts for creating plots.
